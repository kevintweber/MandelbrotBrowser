# Mandelbrot Browser

This is an educational project of mine, intended to teach myself
some Typescript, Webpack, Yarn, Async/Await, and other modern JS techniques.

### Usage
1) Download the contents of the dist directory and put them in the
same directory on your computer.
2) Open the HTML page, and have fun!
